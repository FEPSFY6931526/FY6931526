      This article explains what cluster computing is and why it came around, how it is achieved, through both physical components and software and applications. As well as the reasons behind its use, as well as examples of its use, including the Millenium Simulation.

    <pre>  
    There are many situations in which being able to run software in a parallel state is useful, one such area is complex simulations, that often require hundreds of hours of central processing unit (CPU) time. This led to the development and adaptation of computer clusters, or multiple computers all working on the same simulation or program, running simultaneously to produce the desired outcome. But why clusters of computers, why not just use one very powerful computer. The answer, as it is with so many questions we face today, is money. But this article will tell you a bit more about what, why and look at some examples.

  <h3 id="What">II: What is cluster computing?</h3>
  <p id="What_InText">
    <pre width="160px">When computers where first used to simulate real world problems and solutions, they worked in a sequential manner, that is, each instruction was processed one after another. With early computers, this was deemed to be perfectly acceptable. “In the 1980s, it was believed that computer performance was best improved by creating faster and more efficient processors.” (Baker, M. Buyya, R. 1999). Yet as the amount of data generated by people increased, so did the need to compute this data effectively and efficiently. The answer was to switch towards parallel processing. Instead of performing one instruction at a time, processors were developed with multiple “cores”. At any given time, each core could perform a different instruction, and data could be manipulated faster. Despite this, the need for faster computers was still prevalent. According to Mark Baker and Rajkumar Buyya, the process boiled down to “…linking together two or more computers jointly to solve some problem.” (Baker, M. Buyya, R. 1999). The difference between using a powerful multi-core processor in one computer versus 4-5 less powerful computers is one of cost. As powerful computers became more expensive, the need for a cheaper alternative was necessary. Why spend an excessive amount of funds on one singular computer, which may only be used once or twice, when you could instead use far more less expensive options, and then run them parallel to each other. Whilst it isn’t as simple as my above description, the need was there, and it needed to be met. If one computer could perform multiple instructions at once, why couldn’t multiple computers run at once performing the same task.</pre>
